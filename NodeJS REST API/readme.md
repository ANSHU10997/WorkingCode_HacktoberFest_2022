# NodeJS Rest API

This Rest API project is for fetching data from players in the games of SA-MP and FiveM only, such as the ID, player name, and ping.
I set this NodeJS Rest API to be connected with a Discord bot, so you should create the bot first.

### Instalation

First, clone this repository to your computer

Put the Discord bot token into .env

Install the required packages with NPM (Must have the NodeJS version 16 installed)

```
npm i
```

Run the project

```
node .
```
